# OnionHEN — source tree

This directory is the CMake project for **OnionHEN**, a community continuation of **etaHEN** (LightningMods), licensed under **GPLv3**.

OnionHEN is based on etaHEN’s open-source release. See the [root README](../README.md) for project goals, credits to **GoldHEN** and **etaHEN**, and full documentation.

## Layout

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bootstrapper/` | Main payload bootstrapper |
| `daemon/` | Main daemon |
| `util/` | Utility daemon (cheats, IPC, …) |
| `shellui/` | Toolbox / ShellUI hooks |
| `unpacker/` | Payload unpacker |
| `libhijacker/`, `libNineS/`, `libNidResolver/` | Internal static libs |
| `include/` | Shared headers |
| `common/` | Shared low-level implementations |
| `platform/ps5/stubs/` | PS5 system-library link stubs |

External source and prebuilt dependencies live in the repository-level
[`third_party/`](../third_party/) directory. Downloaded dependency blobs are
cached under `.cache/dependencies/`; they are never stored in `source/`.
Repository-side generators and build helpers live in [`../tools/`](../tools/).

## Build

Requires a Prospero / PS5 payload SDK (`PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK`) and clang targeting `x86_64-sie-ps5`.

**Full pipeline** (preferred) from the repo root:

```bash
export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/path/to/ps5-payload-sdk
./scripts/build.sh
```

Stages external embeds, then shellui → daemon/util → bootstrapper → unpacker.
See [`../third_party/README.md`](../third_party/README.md) and
`./scripts/build.sh --help`.

Manual CMake:

```bash
./scripts/ps5_cmake.sh -S source -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

Build products go under `build/bin/` and `build/lib/` (repo root; gitignored).
